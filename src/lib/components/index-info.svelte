  <h3>Info about the event</h3>
  <p>
    This event is hosted, organized, and curated by the resident artist's of Lacy Studio Lofts. Many of us both live and work here, and realized that we
    wanted to build an event around sharing our work with others.
  </p>
  <p>
    The money from any artwork, clothing, trinkets, puppets, music, tattoos, photos, or any services that you purchase go directly to the artist. We
    are all at different stages of finding our way and your support is immensely helpful and appreciated.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though you are certainly not required to buy anything, if there is a piece of art that moves you or makes you chuckle, you are required to tell
    the artist how much you enjoy it.
