Documenting the Light started as a mantra, then it became a screen name, and now it’s my Brand. The perfect intersection of my love for cinematography and my perspective on life. I’ve spent the last 20 years shooting, producing, and editing videos for all the major publishers while developing my own style and Direction. </br></br> A place between lifestyle and documentary, art and commercial, narrative and prose.",
